Union find
- Dynamic connectivity problem: The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents 
  an object of some type and we are to interpret the pair p q as meaning p is connected to q. 
- We assume that the connection is an equivalence relation: symmetric, transitive, and reflexive
- union command: connect 2 subjects
- connected command: is there a path connecting the two subjects?

Modelling the objects
- Applications involve manipulating objects of all types
- Good to name objects 1, ..., N - 1
- Can use symbol table to translate site names to integers - more in chapter 3

- Quadratic algorithms do not scale with technology
    - New computer must be 10x as fast, but also has 10x as much memory -> wants to solve problem that is 10x as big
    - With Quadratic algorithm, 10x as slow!!
